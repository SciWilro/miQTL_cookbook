# Overall description

This is the cookbook for performing the GWAS analysis of microbial abundance based on analysis of 16S rRNA sequencing dataset. It includes 4 major steps:

1. [Processing of 16S data](#chapter-1-16s-data-processing)
2. [Processing of SNP microarray data](#chapter-2-genotype-imputation)
3. [Performing the association study](#chapter3-peform-genome-wide-association-study)
4. Making the meta-analysis

Steps from 1 to 3 would be performed in-house by every participating group. Step 4 will be performed in UMCG (Groningen). Mostly, you can just copy the code strings from this cookbook and run them, but sometimes it's not the case (yet, but it will be after beta-testing).

#### Genome-Wide Association Study itself will be performed according to this design:

1. Cutoffs and transformations
    + Taxonomies:
        + Abundance cutoff: presence in 10% of the samples
        + Log (base **e**) trasformation on the counts
    + SNPs
        + MAF > 1%
        + Imputation quality > 0.4
        + Genotypes represented in dosages 
2. Models used
    + Taxonomy absence/presence as binary trait: logistic regression with Chisquared-based p-value estimation
    + For non-zero samples: linear regression model on log-transformed counts with Fisher test-based p-value estimation
3. Meta-analysis
    + will be performed separately, for binary and quantitative models

# Chapter 1. 16S data processing

For 16S analysis, RDP Classifier will be used instead of OTU picking, since it has shown more consistent results between different domains. According to the pipeline, Genome-Wide Association Study will be performed for the following taxonomic levels:

1. Taxonomic levels:
    + Classes
    + Orders
    + Phyla
    + Families
    + Genera
2. Cutoffs:
    + Taxonomy should be presented in more than 10% of the samples in cohort
3. Transformations:
    + Taxonomies counts should be log-transformed (on the base ***e***)

## 1.1. 16S data requirements

1. Sequence quality-based read filtering should be performed before rarefaction.
2. Reads should be randomly rarefied to 10,000 reads per sample before OTU picking (See [Appendix2](#Appendix2) )
3. Sequences from all samples should be merged into one file.
4. For every sequence, FASTA header should follow this format:

```
>[SampleID]_[SequenceID] [OptionalInfo]
```

Example of valid fasta record:

```
>G36899_G36899.A2137
TACGTAGGGGGCAAGCGTTATCCGGATTTACTGGGTGTAAAGGGAGCGTAGACGGACTGG
CAAGTCTGATGTGAAAGGCGGGGGCTCAACCCCTGGACTGCATTGGAAACTGTTAGTCTT
GAGTGCCGGAGAGGTAAGCGGAATTCCTAGTGTAGCGGTGAAATGCGTAGATATTAGGAG
GAGCACCAGTGGCGAAGGCGGCTTACTGGACGGTAACTGACGTTGAGGCTCGAAAGCGTG
GGGAGCAAACAGG
```

For this record, SampleID is **G36899**, and SequenceID is **G36899.A2137.451**.

## 1.2. Software and database installation

These software and databases are necessary:

1. Java
2. R
3. RDP Classifier 2.12. Can be downloaded [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/rdp-classifier/)

You also need reference database for RDP Classifier and some additional scripts. They are included in this GitHub page, and located in the folders [database](https://github.com/alexa-kur/miQTL_cookbook/tree/master/database) and [software](https://github.com/alexa-kur/miQTL_cookbook/tree/master/software). The list of things you need to get here includes:

4. SILVA 128 release database prepared for RDP Classifier. available on this Github in the folder named [database](https://github.com/alexa-kur/miQTL_cookbook/tree/master/database). It's a spanned zip archive, so you first need to unzip it. It's also available on the consortium [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/home/Microbiome-QTL_Charge): located in the folder [CookBook_CHARGE_miQTL/database](https://www.dropbox.com/home/Microbiome-QTL_Charge/CookBook_CHARGE_miQTL/database) and named *silva128_rdpDB.zip*. 
5. RDP output parsing script. Located in the folder [software](https://github.com/alexa-kur/miQTL_cookbook/tree/master/software) and named **step1.2_rdp_process.sh**.
6. Script for generating summary statistics **step1.3_generate_summary.R**. Located in the folder [software](https://github.com/alexa-kur/miQTL_cookbook/tree/master/software)
7. Filtering and transformation script **step1.4_filter_and_transform.R**. Located in the folder [software](https://github.com/alexa-kur/miQTL_cookbook/tree/master/software)

Before usage, you can put the scripts and 16S database folter to your project folder. 

## 1.3. Running data processing. 

### Step 1. Taxonomy binning. 

Go to your project folder. Replace SEQUENCES.FASTA to the filename of your 16S sequences and run:

```
java -Xmx10G -jar ./rdp_classifier_2.12/dist/classifier.jar -t ./SILVA128_rdpDB/rRNAClassifier.properties -o results.out SEQUENCES.FASTA
````

File **results.out** will be generated. Please note that this step is time consuming and can take up to several days. 


### Step 2. Process mapping results.

```
bash step1.2_rdp_process.sh results.out 0.8
````

It will generate file **taxonomy_table.txt**, tab-separated table which contains per-sample counts of taxa in your dataset. 


### Step 3. Generate summary statistics

Please run this code and send us the results file **COHORT_NAME_summary_16s.txt** (replace COHORT_NAME to the real name of your cohort)

```
Rscript step1.3_generate_summary.R taxonomy_table.txt COHORT_NAME_summary_16s.txt
```

### Step 4. Abundance filtering and transformation

The script *step1.4_filter_and_transform.R* removes taxonomies presented in less than 10% of samples and performes log transformation 
```
Rscript step1.4_filter_and_transform.R taxonomy table.txt tax_filtered_logTrans.txt 0.1
```

**tax_filtered_logTrans.txt** fill be generated. This file will be used in [GWAS](#chapter3-peform-genome-wide-association-study) .  

# Chapter 2. Genotype imputation

To simplify the analysis, we should have genotypes harmonized between cohorts. We propose to use one imputation server: [Michigan Imputation Server](https://imputationserver.sph.umich.edu/index.html). 
Carolina Medina-Gomez was very pleased to prepase very nice instruction for imputation, please find here, in the file called [Imputation_protocol_description.docx](Imputation_protocol_description.docx). In addition to that, you can also check the documentation on HRC [server help page](https://imputationserver.sph.umich.edu/index.html#!pages/help).

# Appendix 1. OTU-based 16S data processing

For those who are still interested in performing 16S processing for their own purposes, we provide the OTU-based pipeline. Please note that for miQTL meta-analysis we require using RDPclassifer pipeline described in section 1!

## Installation

First we need to install QIIME on your machine. I should be any kind of Linux machine, including physical or virtual machine. You don't need to have root priviliges to use QIIME

```{bash,eval = FALSE}
cd ~/
wget https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
chmod a+x Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash ./Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
#follow installation instructions and install Miniconda in ~/miniconda3 folder
conda create -n qiime1 python=2.7 qiime matplotlib=1.4.3 mock nose -c bioconda
source activate qiime1
#check if installation was finished succesfully
print_qiime_config.py
```

## SILVA database downloading

```{bash,eval = FALSE}
#create project dir
mkdir 16S_picking
#copy your 16S data in the folder
cp PATH_TO_YOUR_FASTA_FILE ./16S_picking
cd 16S_picking

#download SILVA v.119 database
wget https://www.arb-silva.de/fileadmin/silva_databases/qiime/Silva_119_release.zip
unzip Silva_119_release.zip
#create custom config file
echo "\
pick_otus_reference_seqs_fp $PWD/Silva119_release/rep_set/97/Silva_119_rep_set97.fna
pynast_template_alignment_fp $PWD/Silva119_release/core_alignment/core_Silva119_alignment.fna
assign_taxonomy_reference_seqs_fp $PWD/Silva119_release/rep_set/97/Silva_119_rep_set97.fna
assign_taxonomy_id_to_taxonomy_fp $PWD/Silva119_release/taxonomy/97/taxonomy_97_7_levels.txt" > qiime_config
```

## Running the OTU picking (closed OTU picking method with 97% cutoff)

```{bash,eval = FALSE}
# if you have multiple cores, you can run analysis faster in parallel, redefining the $PROCNUM varialbe 
PROCNUM=1
source activate qiime1
export QIIME_CONFIG_FP=$PWD/qiime_config
pick_closed_reference_otus.py -i FASTA_FILE -o RESULT_FOLDER -a -O $PROCNUM
cd RESULT_FOLDER
biom convert -i otu_table.biom -o otu_table.tsv --to-tsv --header-key taxonomy
cat otu_table.tsv|tail -n+2 |perl -pe "s/#OTU ID/OTU_ID/" > temp.tsv
mv temp.tsv otu_table.tsv
```

## Getting taxonomies from OTU table

For this step, you should have R to be installed. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
cutoff_presence = 0.1
get_taxonomy_table = function(otu_table, replace_string,cutoff = 0.1){
  otu_notax = as.matrix(otu_table[,-ncol(otu_table)])
  taxonomy = sub(replace_string,"",otu_table[,ncol(otu_table)])
  dnew = aggregate(otu_notax ~ as.factor(taxonomy),FUN = sum)
  rownames(dnew) = as.character(dnew[,1])
  dnew = dnew[,-1]
  dnew = t(dnew)
  dnew
  filter = dnew[,(colSums(dnew > 0) > 0.1*nrow(dnew))]
  return(dnew)
}
otus = read.table("otu_table.tsv",header=T,row.names=1,sep="\t",as.is = T)
metadata = data.frame(tax = c("genus","family","order","class"),replace_string = c("; D_6.*","; D_5.*","; D_4.*","; D_3.*"))
result = list()
for (i in 1:nrow(metadata)){
  taxonomy_table = get_taxonomy_table(otus,replace_string = metadata[i,2])
  result[[i]] = taxonomy_table
}
final_table = cbind(result[[1]],result[[2]],result[[3]],result[[4]])
final_table = final_table[,(colSums(final_table>0)>cutoff_presence * nrow(final_table))]
final_ln = log(final_table)
final_table[final_table == "-Inf"] = NA
write.table(final_table,file = "microbes.txt",sep="\t")
```

## Appendix 2. FASTA file rarefaction

We recommend to perform rarefaction before running the pipeline. To make it truly random, this procedure can be applied:

1. Install QIIME (see Appendix 1)
2. Create merged file for all samples with number of reads larger than threshold you want 
2. Check if your fasta headers are formatted properly (see section 1)
2. Download script **run_rarefaction.R** from Consofrtium dropbox [CookBook_CHARGE_miQTL/software](https://www.dropbox.com/home/Microbiome-QTL_Charge/CookBook_CHARGE_miQTL/software)
3. Put it into your project folder. Replace SEQUENCES.FASTA to the file where you store your sequences and run:

```{}
Rscript step0.2_run_rarefaction.R SEQUENCES.FASTA 10000
source activate qiime1
filter_fasta.py -f SEQUENCES.FASTA -o SEQ_RARIFIED.FASTA -s 2filter.ids
rm 2filter.ids

```

It will generate rarefied fasta file called **SEQ_RARIFIED.FASTA**
